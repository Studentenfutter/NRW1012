# NRW1012 - Corpus of Plenary Protocols of Hessen State Parliament, legislative periods 9-11 

Corpus of Plenary Protocols of , legislative periods 10-12

This repository contains the plenary protocols of the North Rhine-Westphalia State Parliament from the legislative periods 10 till 12. 
The files where obtained by OCRing the PDF-protocols available via the [archive of the North Rhine-Westphalia State Parliament](https://www.landtag.nrw.de/home/dokumente_und_recherche/dokumentenabruf.html) and therefore contain many scan artifacts at the current state.

This repository is an installable Package for R and can be obtained by executing
```
devtools::install_github("Studentenfutter/NRW1012")
```
It can be used via the [polmineR-Package](https://github.com/PolMine/polmineR) and activated with
```
use("nw1012")
```

Many thanks to Andreas Bl√§tte for providing access to his parsing tools for plenary protocols and to Christoph Leonhardt for additional guidance.
