# Topicmodel visulaisation

These files provide an interactive topic model visualisation, which was used to label the topics.

Both the topic model and the interactive visualisation were created using the `text2vec`-package for R.

To display the visualisation, this directory must be served by a web server (e.g. Apache, NGINX).

To serve this display from R, use the `servr`-package:

`servr::httd(directory)`
